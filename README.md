# Basic-File-Handling-In-C

This repository contains a basic implementation of file handling in C where we are opening the file first.txt and reading the data from it. Then we are writing some text (here Second) in the "First.txt" file and on updation of the "First.txt" file we are printing the message "Write operation successful". To check the updates we can run the program again to see the updated "First.txt" file.
